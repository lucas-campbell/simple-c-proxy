1. in parse_request, uneccessarily (?) add length of "resource" (line 144) if hostname
is not null. is ok? <-- OK i think

2. line 164, strlen-1 should just be strlen(resource)

3. In parse_response (191) we start strtok'ing without copying the string first

4. line 258: should there be a check for if content exists or not?

5. line 248: should manually add \0 to end of ascii_age in order to make sure
that strlen(ascii_age) always works (after the \r\n). Also, doesn't this need
"Age: " before the actual age?
    -->done i think
6. check the shenanigans on line 168 (lots of strlens)
7. need to fix line 732 where we bcopy extern_serverp->h_addr bc it doesn't
exist in that struct appparently? Yet it compiles and works
8. check for line 104/107: does sscanf end "resource" with a null char? if not,
    should either use calloc or add '\0' manually.
