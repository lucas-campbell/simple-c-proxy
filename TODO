1. look @ case of given invalid host or port number -- what return?
    - e.g. portno over 65535 -- would handle in parse_request, near line 150

2. Replace exit() calls with just error messages, then clean up (memory, reset 
        vars, etc) and keep going
    - parse_request()
    - 

3. takes of line 755 of closing connection when no hostname provided. need to 
    fwd and probably get back error code 400 instead (?). But also,
    getting the hostname from a url sounds hard.
    - make sure any edits ALSO set the default portno to 80

4. add logic in parse_request() to differentiate btwn absolute and authority
    forms of the URI (According to RFC 7230#Host, when a proxy receives the
    absolute-form it is supposed to ignore the Host header and just parse the
    URI for the host (and then replace the Host header). Also, make sure that
    all CONNECT request honly have the authorit-form of the URI
    
5. Ensure that when close fds replace the corresponding values in sock_map with -1

6. Need some way to differentiate btwn incoming responses to GET and CONNECT
    requests. If GET, want to store in buffer until have entire response and
    then cache it. This can be packet by packet or all at once, but still
    want to store the repsonse.
    CONNECT pkts are forwarded right away.
